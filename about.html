<p>
    The <b>Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</b>, directed by Dr. Seongmin A. Park in the <a href="https://psyc.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Psychology at Virginia Tech,</a> investigates the computational principles by which the human brain supports intelligence, learning, and flexible decision-making. 
    We’re interested in how the brain makes sense of different experiences and turns them into useful knowledge. We study how it builds internal models of the world—mental structures that help us reason, predict what might happen next, and make smart decisions in new situations.
    <br> <br>Our research combines behavioral experiments, neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, OPM-MEG, and EEG), and computational modeling, including both normative models and neural networks.
    By integrating approaches from psychology, neuroscience, machine learning, and behavioral economics, we aim to understand how the brain represents concepts, learns structural relationships, and makes novel inferences.
